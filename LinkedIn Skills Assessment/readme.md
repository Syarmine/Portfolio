## LinkedIn Skill Assessment PowerBI Report

> This is part of my weekend project. Diving into Fabric's analytics.

## Motivation

I'm revealing a simple, yet powerful LinkedIn trick to improve your job application success. Recruiters won't just notice you; they'll prioritize you - even with different background.

## The Solution 
I used PowerBI for a simple analysis due to the lack of a filter in the skills assessment section, for easier navigation for myself. Then I think why not share it via Fabric, perhaps it might benefit others as well.

Feel free to explore!

## Problem Statement 

Imagine there are 1,000 candidates applying the same roles. 
1. How do I improve my visibility and rank higher in a recruiter’s talent pool?
2. What are the actionable steps?

To do that, we need to understand:
LinkedIn as a hiring platform. Keyword: algorithm!
-  It is a well-known approach to fill in every detail on LinkedIn as accurately as possible - many have talked about this. How can you set yourself apart? 
- So, do you know there is something call "demonstrate skills" in LinkedIn?
- If you already know, have you attempted the free "demonstrate skills" section on LinkedIn?

## Context 
LinkedIn, aimed at boosting hiring efficiency, introduced the Skill Assessment in 2019 to authenticate your skills. 

- Recruiters can use search filters to evaluate candidate suitability. Don’t let filters cost you your dream job.
- So understanding that, what should you do? Do LinkedIn best practices as candidates, complete all the prompt they created, and attempt the "Skill Assessment" section. 
- Of course, this is not the only thing you should be focusing on in a job application though!

## Reason
Don't waste your time and recruiter's time. Put all the cherry on top in LinkedIn for a job application - try to achieve approximate similarity for the job description. Don't forget to work on the following as well:

* ✅Work Experience
* ✅Projects
* ✅Education
* ✅Certifications
* ✅Course Completions

## Actionable Step
What should you do then?

TLDR: Just do all of the skills assessment available!

* ✅There are 93 assessments available, each has 15 MCQs. 
* ✅ Timed question, can finish around 15-20 minutes. 
* ✅ Although open book, it is quite difficult to do the searching due to timed questions

## Why Should You Take The Assessment?
Why is taking the skill assessment important?

> 8 billion people on Earth. Near 1 billion on LinkedIn. How do you compete and stands out against other candidate?

Through such a tool, LinkedIn is able to shortlist candidates to 4% out of all profiles on LinkedIn. 

Imagine being sifted away just because of this.

## Data Exploration

Let's make sense on the available  data of the assessment.

On LinkedIn
1. What are the most commonly taken tests worldwide? - looks like Excel is number one! 
2. What are the least frequently taken assessment globally? - Ruby? should you learn this to rank higher?

In order to pass the assessment, LinkedIn introduces a certain level of complexity. 

You will be awarded a badge & higher visibility on recruiter's dashboard if your score within the top 30% of all scores. 

Additionally, some may scores within the top 15% or even the top 5%.

## Conclusion
So, what are you waiting for? Are you still considering on whether should you take this assessment? 

This is one of the many ways in which you and the recruiter can collaboratively enhance the efficiency of the hiring process.
